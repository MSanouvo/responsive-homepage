# responsive-homepage

A mock homepage with a responsive layout (project provided by 'The Odin Project')

This project served as some time off from JavaScript in order to go back retouch some CSS topics, mainly media queries and responsive design. I tried to keep the CSS initially responsive while using the media queries for certain widths to provide small changes to some of the content that felt needed. In addition, I tried to relabel the html to have more semanctical meaning.

Realistically, there is probably more that could be done design wise, but that might lead into a rabbit hole of minmaxing CSS styles for a mock webpage.
